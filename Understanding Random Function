# Pseudo code

# Hangman Steps

# 1. Get the ASCII ART for Hangman (complete)

# 2. Make a word bank
chosen_word = ["Sherrard", "Tiera", "Kai", "Kairo", "Kaila", "Kailee"]
#
# 3. Make word bank random
# random.shuffle function randomly shuffles list by modifying the original list.
random.shuffle(chosen_word)
print(chosen_word)

# random.sample function randomly shuffles list by creating a new list and keep original list intact
shuffled_word = random.sample(chosen_word, len(chosen_word))
print(shuffled_word)

# random.shuffle() and random.sample() both use permutation to randomize objects in python.
# permutation is the arrangement of items in a specific order

# Example 1: Permutations of 3 Items
# Items: [A, B, C]
#
# Possible arrangements (permutations):
#
# [A, B, C]
#
# [A, C, B]
#
# [B, A, C]
#
# [B, C, A]
#
# [C, A, B]
#
# [C, B, A]
#
# 3!=3×2×1=6.
